# Language Model (LM) Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`LM.ipynb`) that demonstrates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using deep learning frameworks. The notebook covers text preprocessing, model implementation, and visualization using Python libraries such as NLTK, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Transformers.

## Features
- Installation of required dependencies
- Importing necessary libraries
- Text preprocessing using NLTK
- Deep learning models using PyTorch and TensorFlow
- Visualization of NLP processes using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Installation
To run the notebook, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install nltk torch transformers tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LM.ipynb
   ```
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute the NLP tasks.
